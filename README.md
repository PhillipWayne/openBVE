openBVE: A Free, open source train simulator!

This branch is an attempt to make openBVE and its development tools easier to use for Mac users, as i myself am a Mac user.

The master branch contains the source code and binaries which odakuyfan and his fellow team have coded. I have enabled these binaries for large address aware.
